# Hello-world
Basics first

### Welcome to my website

0. Clone the repository (just for new repos)
1. Create a new branch (on VS Code)
2. Make changes (on VS Code)
3. Add, commit, and push (on VS Code)
4. github.com Create pull request and merge branch
5. Don't forget to switch back to the master branch after you delete a feature branch (in VS Code)


```git fetch```: Looks if there's changes on the remote (online) branch DOESN'T DOWNLOAD THEM
```git pull```: Downloads the changes to local (on your computer) branch
Pull requests are for merging branches (after pushing)
